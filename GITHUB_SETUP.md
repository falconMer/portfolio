# GitHub Repository Setup

After creating your repository on GitHub, run the following commands to push your code:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

These commands will:
1. Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository
2. Rename your default branch to "main"
3. Push your code to GitHub

After pushing your code, you can proceed with setting up Netlify deployment through GitHub.
